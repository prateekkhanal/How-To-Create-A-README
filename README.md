# Emphasizing the text

## Italicize

You can *italicize* text by using either \*\[sometext in here\]\* or \_\[sometext in here\]\_. 

## Bold

You can **bold out** text by using either \*\*\[sometext in here\]\*\* or \_\_\[sometext in here\]\_\_.

# Escaping 

The back-slash "`\`" is used as the escape character in markdown files.   
For example: `**bold**` would generate **bold** as the output in the markdown files. For \*\*bold** to be the output in the markdown files, you have to escape the asterisks(\*) before the word(bold) by putting backslash(`\`) before them i.e. `\*\*bold**`

>__If, when I attain Buddhahood, sentient beings in the lands of the ten quarters who sincerely and joyfully entrust themselves to me,  
>desire to be born in my land, and call my Name, even ten times, should not be born there, may I not attain perfect Enlightenment.  
>Excluded, however, are those who commit the five gravest offences and abuse the right Dharma.__
